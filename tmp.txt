I would like to create a web application for organizing test tube blood samples
the site should have functionality to create racks that have a custom name, row, and column size
in each rack. 

users can view, create, remove samples/
each sample must have a unique id, comment(optional),location, created and modified date
if users manually chose a location it cannot exceed the bounds of the rack size
nor can they choose a location that is already occupied.
users may delete samples however would like a history page where users can restore entires if needed
